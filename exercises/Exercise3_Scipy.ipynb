    "Rainfall in many dryland ecosystems exhibits pronounced variability from year to year. Because rainfall occurs intermittently and with a low degree of predictability, we often are forced to characterize the occurrence and amount of rainfall in terms of **probability**. In this exercise, we will investigate the probabilistic nature of rainfall at various locations in Kenya. We will use these data to explore the concepts of probability and conditional probability, as well as probability density functions and cumulative density functions. We will use these data to develop a stochastic model of rainfall that can be used to generate  novel time series of rainfall and develop inference into the likelihood of various daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall totals. \n",

    "A simple rainfall model makes two assumptions; (1) that events arrive according to a Poisson process, and (2) that rainfall depths are distributed according to an exponential distribution. These two assumptions are accompanied by the need for two rainfall parameters; (1) the probability of rainfall events, $\\lambda_r$, and the average depth of rainfall events $\\alpha$. We've already seen how to estimate both of these parameters from rainfall data, so here we are going to focus on testing the appropriateness of the model assumptions during the growing season for Laikipia, Kenya.\n",

    "To fit the distribution, we are going to use some more functions from <span class=\"code\">python</span>'s suite of numerical analysis. In this case we are going to use some functions from <span class=\"code\">scipy</span>. The [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) module has a large suite of distribution functions pre-defined, which we can use to develop a fit for our data. Using any of these distributions for fitting our data is very easy. The distribution we are most interested in is the exponential distribution, which is called `expon` in the `stats` module.\n",

For now, we assume stationarity in the monthly values, which means that we are assuming that the values of $\\lambda_r$ in each month are the same through out the entire record (i.e. Jan 1938 has the same properties as Jan 2008). \n",

Our implementation ‚Äì using monthly values ‚Äì is a little clunky, and we'd prefer to have the $\\lambda$ values change more smoothly throughout the year.
